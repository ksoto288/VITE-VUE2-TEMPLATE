# -VITE-VUE2-PROJECT-TEMPLATE

This is the template I use for my Vue.Js projects. It contains my most commonly used tools and folder structure. 

After cloning, make sure to get every dependency with npm **(npm install)**.

# Tools

**Vuetify** as the UI component library: https://vuetifyjs.com/en/. 

**Vite** as the build tool: https://vitejs.dev/.

**Pinia** for state management: https://pinia.vuejs.org/.
